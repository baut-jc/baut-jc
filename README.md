    In a world of tech, a new adventure takes flight,<br> 
    As I dive headfirst into its realms of light, <br>
    Freshly graduated, a wizard in the making, <br>
    My coding journey, a path for the taking. 
    <br><br>
    Research and docs, my trusty guides, <br>
    In this digital wonderland, my knowledge abides,<br> 
    Eager to learn, with an insatiable zeal, <br>
    Each line of code, a thrill I feel.
    <br><br>
    Beyond the screens, I seek the great unknown, <br>
    Outdoor wonders, a place I call my own, <br>
    From tranquil hikes to adrenaline's rush, <br>
    Nature's embrace, my soul it does hush.
    <br><br>
    Art and creation, my heart's sweet refrain,<br> 
    Drawing, crafting, it's all in my domain, <br>
    With lights and cooking, a cozy delight, <br>
    A warm escape from the techy night.
    <br><br>
    Frontend's my forte, crafting websites with flair, <br>
    But my journey's just starting, so much to declare, <br>
    From teacher to hotel, a varied past I've tread, <br>
    Now a coder, I'm ready to forge ahead.
